 Flask allows you to register environment variables that you want to be automatically imported when you run the flask command. 
To use this option you have to install the python-dotenv package:

pip install python-dotenv

Then you can just write the environment variable name and value in a .flaskenv file in the top-level directory of the project:


pip install csvtojson
